## DATA CENTERS AND PHYSICAL STORAGE

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB.
MongoDB Atlas is built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Amazon Web Services

Customer data is stored in MongoDB Atlas Systems; 
these systems are single-tenant dedicated AWS EC2 virtual servers that are created solely for an Atlas Customer.  These virtual servers are isolated within their own dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and do not share logical data storage or processing with other customers. Amazon AWS data centers are compliant with a number of physical security and information security standards. 

Please visit AWSâ€™s Compliance page if more detail regarding physical security is required. Please note: MongoDB Atlas customers deploying M0, M2, and M5 instances will use a multi-tenant system.
