- We use RSA encryption.

-RSA encryption is more secure than AES256.

- We can also use AES256 symmetric cipher for encryption, but then we will have to share the symmetric key between the end-points (frontend and backend).  

- RSA takes more time, but for a video of 3-4 hours, the time taken for encryption/decryption will only vary by a few seconds/
