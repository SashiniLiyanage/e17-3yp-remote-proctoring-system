## PROBLEM STATEMENT

When conducting examinations where the skills of the students in a limited timeframe, it's crucial to manage the external factors affecting the performance of the students at a satisfactory level. 
However it could be challenging to manage these factors in an online environment.

## SOLUTION

We have come up with a single device which integrates the hardware and software components needed to conduct an examination in the currently implemented system, which will provide a seamless process for the proctors and students involved in an examination.
